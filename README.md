# Computer Network Projects – Cisco Packet Tracer

This repository contains **network design and simulation files** created using  
**Cisco Packet Tracer** as part of my **Computer Networks and CCNA (200-301) learning and practice**.

The files in this repository focus on **campus networks, hotel management networks, and basic routing/switching scenarios**.

---

## Contents of the Repository

This repository includes multiple `.pkt` files covering different network problems and scenarios, such as:

- Campus Network Design Problems
- Hotel Management Network Scenarios
- Basic Routing and Switching Practice
- VLAN, IP addressing, and inter-network communication
- CCNA (200-301) course-related practice files

---

## File Description

Some example files included:

- `CAMPUS NETWORK PROBLEM.pkt`  
- `hotel mangment.pkt`  
- `hotel mangment problem 3.pkt`  
- `prob 1.pkt`, `prob 2.pkt`  
- `CCNA 200-301 Course Files`

Each `.pkt` file represents a **complete network topology** built and tested in Cisco Packet Tracer.
